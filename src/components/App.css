/*  
    Note that anything added/changed here applies to every page/view on the site, page specific css should be in its own file.

    I deleted the styles you had added here as most of it could be accomplished in Bootstrap, which keeps things simpler.
    Note also that I returned the <Container> to the index.jsx as this helps with responsiveness and centering content.
    THe #root rule is there to add the background image to the page, remember this is now on every page, the height: 100vh 
    ensures the background fills the height of the screen (100 % of the Viewport Height)
